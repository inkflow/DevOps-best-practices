 DevOps心理学：明白"人"才是成功的关键
_(The psychology of DevOps: Understanding people is key to success)_

社会学家查尔斯·霍顿·库里认为，“人的脑海是一个充满奇思怪想的洞穴，许多的想法是无意识和潜藏的。除非我们能明白一些规律，比如这些朦胧想法的动机是如何产生的，否则我们很难去期望能够预见或控制这些想法。”

已故的库里博士本可以成为一个出色的DevOps顾问的。

DevOps，一种开发人员和运维人员密切合作、脱离局限，以期更频繁地发布代码到生产环境中的方法 —— 它不仅是IT领域中的热门词汇，更是一种极少见的软件开发模式，一种强调人员而不是技术的软件部署模式（尽管部署的实施肯定要依赖于工具和流程）。

事先声明，我认为，能教给我们更多关于DevOps知识的学科不是计算机科学或工程学，而是心理学。这是一个组织在推广DevOps时必须牢记的。Gartner在今年年底说过，“DevOps已从大型云服务提供商这一细分市场所使用的策略转变为全球2000个组织中的25%都在采用的主流策略”。这是他演讲的链接。

## DevOps的心理学分析
应用DevOps，对于开发人员和运维人员“政教分离”的传统情况，产生了一种戏剧性的文化转变。它容易引发一些可以破坏组织DevOps转型的情绪化陷阱，就如“菲尔博士小插曲”。害怕冲突和改变，失去掌控感，利己式的想法 ———— 这些只是DevOps转型会带来的问题中的一小部分。
这些影响了DevOps的心理力量，可以追溯到DevOps发展的童年时期。当开发人员承受着以惊人的速度创造新产品和新特性的压力时，他们会是最先去推动与产品方加强合作的一方。而运维人员则会更慢。

## 巨大的分裂
这种分裂是一开始就存在的。随着越来越多的组织转向了持续部署的模式，开发人员希望能不断推出新的软件。持续交付最先被亚马逊、网飞和最近的优步等本土的数字型企业应用，许多开发团队都羡慕他们看到的这种极速模式。另一方面，对于有责任保障软件的可用性可靠性的运维团队而言，DevOps更像是个非常野蛮的环境。对运维团队来说，如果不能保证新软件的质量，那么更快的部署是无益的。

## 巨大的不确定性
使事情更复杂的是，比起一系列清晰的战略和流程，DevOps更像是一种哲学性的倡议。它不像ITIL（信息技术基础设施库）那样，通过一系列的实践来将选择、交付、IT服务支持等标准化，并与业务需求保持一致。目前，DevOps缺乏可供操作执行的明确框架。但在任何一个演讲者讲述他们怎么做到DevOps的会议上，人们都对如何执行DevOps一直充满着好奇，会议室里总是挤满了人。

## DevOps mapped to psychological phenomena
Like nature, the poorly defined terrain of DevOps abhors a vacuum. If organizations aren’t careful, bad vibes could hinder their DevOps initiatives. Here are a few examples of the psychological phenomena that often are at play and what we can learn from them:

Fear of change: One of the most powerful human emotions is fear, and fear is frequently triggered by change. DevOps marks a huge change, especially for operations teams, and who can blame them for worrying? They perhaps can take comfort in Dr. Susan Biali’s observations in Psychology Today: “Any time you're out of your comfort zone, you're going to feel anxious. Just because you feel anxious does not mean something bad is going to happen. In fact, for me most of the time anxiety means something really great is going on and that I'm moving through new territory in the direction of my dreams.”

Social identity theory: This theory, developed by British social psychologist Henri Tajfel, holds that people derive their pride and self-esteem based on their group memberships—whether a social class, family, or work department—and that in order to increase self-image, humans tend to enhance the status of the group to which they belong. This also leads to people dividing the world into “them” and “us.” The best way for both sides of the DevOps house to overcome this tendency is to recognize that they both live in the same large house. The organization needs them to be on the same page and accelerate software delivery for competitive advantage.

Self-serving bias: This principle describes people’s tendency to ascribe their successes to personal traits and talents while blaming failures on other people or external factors outside their control. The lesson for DevOps? There should be no “other”—both sets of players are part of the same crucial mission and, in that context, parochial finger-pointing makes no sense.

Contact hypothesis: American psychologist Gordon Allport laid out a psychological framework for alleviating conflict between groups of people—including a sense of equal status, a sharing of common goals, intergroup cooperation, and personal interaction. Applying these tenets to DevOps could go a long way toward easing conflicts between the development and operations teams.

## The attentive parent: A vital new role for the C-suite
What else can be done to build bridges between DevOps stakeholders?

As with a child, early DevOps adoption can benefit immeasurably from an attentive parent. That means the C-suite should take an active executive sponsorship role. Too often today, DevOps exists as point or trial projects by individual teams within companies rather than a strategic, enterprise-wide initiative. Projects aren’t a bad way to start, but to meet the full promise of DevOps, you need a structured mandate for change, and that need to come from the top.

At the same time, leaders should accept another important psychological element, autonomy, and allow teams to choose the tools for carrying out their DevOps mission. Technologies have come to market that automate many of the tasks and processes needed to meet DevOps’ objective of faster software releases. Gartner says these tools grew to a $2.3 billion market last year, with far greater growth ahead. But senior executives should understand that the best decisions about what tools to use should reside with those using them.

By considering DevOps as we might consider a complex individual, maturing through trials and achievements as they embark on their journey, organizations have a familiar set of psychological tools at their disposal for achieving an important business objective. The goal is a fully functional, mature process, one that significantly decreases software release time and responds quickly to market and customer demands.
